“The most useful piece of learning for the uses of life is to unlearn what is untrue.”  - Antisthenes
 

In fitness, a lot of the information that we read is untrue. More like exaggerated.
I will talk about it later but what we need to talk about right now is - you need to unlearn everything you know about dieting or fat loss.

 - WTF, I thought I will be learning something new but you are asking me to forget everything?

I will explain, be with me.
Look, if you had learned the alphabets the wrong way, would you still be able to read this email? Probably not. I need you to unlearn everything before you start this course. In this course, I will be sharing the locked secrets that only coaches know and which media won’t ever share with you.
The reason - it doesn’t make money for them.


- Then why are you sharing for free, what’s the hidden catch here?

There is no hidden catch here. None.
I have been in your position who wants be healthy but the media would try selling another Lame shit that I don’t need. I earn 0.00 INR from it but saving your bucks will make it worth all the sleepless brain-porn nights.



- Cut the crap girl, start teaching us!

Hey, don’t talk to a queen with that language. Anyway, here you go.


 
##Chapter 1 - Why you can’t lose weight?
 

Since you are reading this, I presume that dieting is not your strong skills. You gave up your favorite dessert to stick to your diet plan. But did it work for you? Did you lose enough weight and achieved your #bodygoals?

If not, here’s why it went wrong for you :

# 1. The Binge-Guilty Cycle -

Okay, tell me how many times have you have rode this binge-guilty cycle : 
Get pumped up to start dieting, go to a gym and everything to be healthy.
Start eating healthy but start craving for food.
Eat the cake you were craving for but ...you ate a whole damn cake.
Dayum. You ruined everything and now you can’t do anything. You ruined your diet.
Whatever. Food is bae and #bodypositivity.
 
Basically, where you go from step 1-5 and then back again, and again, and again. Scary part if that most of us fail to break that cycle.
They give up.

Now tell me, if you were driving a car and one of the tires got punctured. Would you puncture all the other 3 tires too or fix the damaged one?
Then, why do you give up on dieting if you ate a cake once?
Why do you think you ruined the progress you made because of one cake?

Your brain will trick you to give up because your body doesn’t want to you eat less ( true story). But don’t let it trick you to puncture the remaining three tires.
Ate a cake? Cool, eat a bit less next day.
Didn’t follow the diet plan today? Cool, Move around a bit more.


# 2. The Dichotomy Of Food -

Salad is good. Burger is bad.
Apple is good. Cake is bad.
Juice is good. Coke is bad.

The concept of having two different baskets - “the good” and “the bad” to categorize food is a trap that we all fell into. We believe that if we eat anything from the “good” basket, it will make us immortal.
And thus, the general concept of : 

Getting healthy = Dieting = eating from “good” basket

If you eat even the smallest unit from “ the bad basket”, The whole world would come crumbling down. You ruined the progress completely.
The problem with this idea of two different baskets is that such a thing does not exist.

There is no good or bad or ugly food. Food is just food.
If you want to be healthy, start being active. More a lot more. Eat a bit less. There is no need to confuse yourself with two different baskets.
(I will talk about it in detail in next chapter )



# 3. Go Hard Or Go Home - 

This is one of the quotes I used to believe back then, guilty.
Either you should give 100% or don’t even try. If you can’t stick with your diet plan All the time, i.e even you messed up 0.1% you should give up.
Go home, girl.

TBH, this mentality of seeing it as 0 or 100 is actually stopping you to reach your goals. Unless you have to be on stage next month, you don’t have to be on the extreme #GoHardOrGoHome phase.
There is a whole spectrum of values from 0 to 100.
You could be sticking with the plan 80% of the time and you will still be fine. You could be eating according to your diet plan 6 days a week and ate a cake once and you will still be fine.


# 4. Trying To Be An Ironman : 

“ Tomorrow, I am going to get up at 6 am, go to the gym, cut out sugar completely, eat salad and measure all my food. “



You try to do everything. You try to become the child your mother always wanted in a day. You try to change all your 20+ years of habit overnight. But what happens after a week?

The old habits pull you right back to where you started. Old habits aren’t so easy to change. Most people give up dieting after a few weeks because they didn't let go of their old habits.

If you want to change your old habits, you have to create new habits. Simple.
The catch being, new habits won’t form in a day. You have to take small steps each day to bring the change. Start small rather than jumping straight into the waters.

If you want to start working out, start with 2 days/week.
If you eat a lot of outside food, reduce the quantity.

You get the point, right?

`Fitness ain't a sprint, it's a marathon. Fitness is a lifestyle and you have to be smart enough in tricking your brain to build new habits.`


Well, that's a wrap up for today. I hope you understood how not to do dieting and how you can trick your mind to not suck at dieting. For the next chapter, we will be learning the right way of doing dieting. Till then, unlearn before we can get started with the learning part.

But, wait. Before you go, tell me if you ever fell into one of the above traps before. Which habit of yours is the most difficult to change?
