Finally opening my box of secrets

Excited?

Don’t want to kill your vibe but first let’s recap the last chapter :

No Food is Good or bad and it’s all about the calories.
You have to eat less than you burn to lose fat i.e. be in a calories deficit.
So it’s simple, right? Eat less and you will lose fat.

But then why most of us fail to even lose 2-3 kgs in months? We all know that we need to eat less to lose fat but then why aren’t we losing weight?

Because it’s not that simple. The concept of calories might look like an easy wedding dance but it’s more complicated than the salsa
( yes, I just compared calories to dance styles ).

In the last email, I did not reveal the components in the equation of creating calories deficit.

So, let’s dig into it today.

To recap the calories deficit equation :

`Amount of Fat loss = Calories Out - Calories In`

Greater the difference between your calories in and calories out, more the fat loss.

Thus, to increase the amount of fat loss you should focus on :
+ Either decreasing calories In
+ Or Increasing calories out
+ Or both.

# I can decrease calories in by eating less but how to increase calories out? Should I do cardio to increase it?

Cardio is not as effective as people expect it to be. I will explain why.

See, the process of burning energy by your body is a complicated process and it’s the most misunderstood part when it comes to creating calories deficit. 

You need to understand the components first.
I will break down each component of calories out in the simplest way possible, I swear.

## 1 BMR or basal metabolic rate :

This is the major component, around 70 % of the calories burnt by your body. It’s the energy required to keep your body functioning when you are resting.


## 2 TEA or Calories burnt from Exercise :

It’s the energy you burn when working out, lifting weight or any other form of exercise, including cardio. But, it forms only 10 - 15 % of the total calories burnt in a day.

Only 10 -15 %.

Yet people hop on the first treadmill they see without realizing that it makes up for only 10 -15 % of the total calories out.

## 3 TEF or Calories burnt for digestion: 

Feel warm post your meals? This is the energy your body burns to digest food. It’s quite a small component and does not change often.
To see how small, for a person having total calories out = 2000 kcals, TEF will be only 200-250 kcals.

## 4. NEAT - Calories burnt in an activity other than exercise  such as fidgeting, lifting a pen, etc.

If you can increase either of these components or all, you can increase your calories burnt in a day. Hence, lose more fat. Hence, become sexy af. 


# But if cardio does not burn much energy how should I increase my calories out, I am confused?

So, this is the time when I am opening my ” box of secrets”.



The secret is - `increase your NEAT`


Most people overlook this component but you should not.

NEAT is like a  black box. You can’t measure it. You can’t calculate its value with any instruments.

But you can increase it.

Almost increase it by 200-1000 kcals.

It’s a component which can change the ball game for almost everyone when they are trying to lose fat.

 

# Woah, get to the point and tell me how to increase it?

I can see the excitement. You might be expecting some technical answer but the answer is quite simple.

+ Walk around a lot more.
+ Walk around in your home.
+ Go for an evening walk.
+ Walk to the kitchen to get a glass of water.
+ Take your dog for a walk.


`Just walk around a lot more.`

You can do it, right? So I have a task for you :

Set a goal of walking 10000 steps each day for the next 1 week. Everyday. No excuses.

Tag  #My10K so that I can find you easily on the social media.

I am pumped up. Let’s do it.

Let’s start applying knowledge for out better future and our better health.
