Hi,
It's Calories Queen.

Firstly, a warm welcome to the team of geeks. I'm glad you decided to join – we're gonna have tons of fun. You're now a part of an exclusive crew who are hell-bent on looking sexy as ___ (insert inappropriate noun as needed)

OK, so before I go on, I want to make sure that we're on the same page:

I'm not here to sell you any LAME TRICKS to get six pack abs in 3 weeks. This course is all about helping you learn the nuances of dieting and creating an awesome physique and sticking to it for, well, life. 
To keep it simple, it's mostly for beginners so even if you have no ducking idea about calories, that's cool. We will start from scratch.  

`What To Expect?`

Expect posts from me anywhere between 1-3 times a week.
Every Sunday: I will answer the Question coming from your guys or address common queries people have regarding their diets. 
So, to ensure that you don’t miss your weekly dose of myth-busting: make sure that you bookmark this website.
Occasionally, I'll email if I have any announcements or If I have something that I think you would be interested in (#sales).

`So, What Now?`

• Get your pen and paper out. 
• Or, take a peruse of my [Instagram][instagram] page where I tend to post 2-3x per week; it's short, bite-size content on training, nutrition, or just random thoughts I'm having.
And, that's it.
Before you go, though.
Look, I know you signed up for this course for a reason, maybe you want to know how to diet, maybe you're confused about nutrition - whatever the case is, can you do me a favor?
I'd love if you answered this question:

What one thing can I help you with?

Hit reply to this email and let me know. I read everything I get.

Talk soon,
– Calories Queen
