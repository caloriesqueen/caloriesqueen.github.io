Hey ,
 
The information shared in the last 4 posts is the foundational stone of every coaching certification. So, go pat on your back because now you are kind of a coach too. 

In the last 4 chapters you have learned:
+ How not to do dieting
+ The concept of calories in and calories out
+ Setting up macros.
+ Bullsh*t information media spreads.

I am glad you have come so far.
The reason I started this course was to save people from the frustration of dieting. I know it is frustrating to diet and it messes up the mental health of many.

You try everything only to feel disappointed and think “It’s not for me, I can’t do it”.

There is correct information available too. I agree. But in this industry, hardly anyone is going to hand out the information for free.
But I believe in something else.
 
“In today's environment, hoarding knowledge ultimately erodes your power. If you know something very important, the way to get power is by actually sharing it.” ― Joseph Badaracco

Hence, even on a Monday morning when I am cluttered up with chores, I get up to write this post. It’s something which gets me out of my bed at 6:00 am on Monday morning. Thus, I will share my knowledge as much as possible. If you need extra resources, do reach out to me. I am always reading your emails.

Okay, rant over. Let’s get back.

The four points are enough to set up the plan and live happily and healthily ever after. If you can set up your own calories and macros, you will be far better than most of the people or even some coaches.

But, I want to give it all.

I want to take you to the other world. The Micro-world.

It’s going to be a short ride but I promise it will be worth it. Wait, no, I don’t promise that.

So, will you hop on?
 
##Chapter 4 - The Micro-world


The micro world is a bit untouched by many.Because it’s boring.
Yet essential.

Heard about vitamins and minerals? They comprise the micro world of nutrition.
Vitamins and minerals are important for the functioning of your body. They might look micro and unimportant but miss out any of them and you are sure to run into its deficiency.

`Deficiency = doctor’s bill = $$$$$$`

So, pay attention here. It is boring but like I said it's going to be a short ride.

#Vitamins - 

Vitamins are the organic compounds and essential for your body. They are of two types - Fat soluble and water soluble. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat soluble so they can be stored in your body. Vitamins B and C are water soluble and hence need to be consumed daily as they cannot be stored.

All the vitamins are required in a particular amount and can be obtained from food directly.

Thus, it is vital to include vegetables and fruits in your diet plan to prevent deficiency of any vitamin. This is where “All Calories are not the same” become effective.

If you are not able to consume the required amount of vitamins, then supplement it with multivitamin capsules.

#Minerals - 

Like vitamins, minerals play a role in every process your body performs. While minerals are the most basic form of matter, their functions are often complex. Minerals are not produced by the body, and so must be obtained from food or supplements.

Important ones you should look out for :
    1. Calcium: for muscle growth, bone strength, and heart functions
    2. Iron: Important for blood flow, red blood cells count, and the immune system. 
    3. Zinc: Important for the immune system and muscle growth.
    4. Magnesium: deficiency of it can affect your metabolism and lower body temperatures.

These 4 are the most important minerals and should be supplemented in case you cannot consume it from food. Vegetables and fruits will be the main source including meat, eggs, and dairy.



Done.
That’s the end of the ride. Short but important.


I have touched on the concepts of supplements but I will be discussing them in detail in the next chapter.
If you are confused about supplements like BCAA, creatine, etc and want the real insight why 192772654 supplements present are WORTHLESS, wait for the next chapter.

It’s going to save a lot of money.

Until then, tell me if you are working on your diet plan.
Did you try to set your calories and macros based on the last chapter?
If you did, you are amazing!
Share it with me to see if everything is right.
